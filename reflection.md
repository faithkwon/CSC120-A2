What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


What worked for me was looking at the procedural code and copying and pasting a lot of the text, while changing the order and syntax to shift to object oriented programming. Even though it took a minute to visualize how the code would look like using methods and objects, once it clicked, I was able to do so. 

What didn't work for me was staring at it for a long time with no help; I couldn't have completed this assignment without utilizing other resources (i.e. friends and Google) to help me along when I got stuck.
